flutter run

# Run below command to run app on a real device (you can get device ID via `adb devices` command)
flutter run -d DMYX75XGPFYLSSKV # Here `DMYX75XGPFYLSSKV` is device ID of my Poco Phone

# Use below command to run app on enulator
flutter run -d emulator-<emulator_number>
```

## Accessiblity

- Flutter Docs | Screen readers: [Click here](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/accessibility#screen-readers)

1. tab switching works quite cool with a list of websited made with flutter
2. VoiceOver (apple official screen reader app) doesn't work great at all, check this issue: [Click here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/115158) (~found by Eric)

*As per testing from Eric, screen readers doesn't work when tested from the resource of reddit i.e, "List of web apps built with Flutter".*
